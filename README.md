We have provided the complete folders of each model, the main code of each model is
provided in main for convenience and a demo for each model is provided.
The two files contain the main code for the two different models that both function as a stylophone. 
The backup model only uses a Nucleo-L476RG board to play the keys, 
while the potentiometer model uses the Nucleo-L476RG board and potentiometers for each key.
