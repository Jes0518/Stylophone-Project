We have provided the complete folders of each model, the main code of each model is
also in the main, a demo for each model, and the design of each model.
The two files contain the main code for the two different models that both function as a stylophone.
The pin model only uses a Nucleo-L476RG board to play the keys,
while the potentiometer model uses the Nucleo-L476RG board and potentiometers for each key.
